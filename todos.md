ok so its clear i am going to improve my api page for SEO and also my rapidapi docs and then i come up with an posting strategy. and i need to make a hierarchy list of which apis to implement next.

- hierarchy list of which apis to implement next
    - lets make the captioner api - maybe i can directly use an api which i later potentially use for magic hour
- scaling of apis based on hierarchy list and my routine steps for making an api


## next apis to implement 

- ai photo restoration -  
- ai 3d model api
- ai music generator api
- text to speech ai api
- Pdf to markdown
