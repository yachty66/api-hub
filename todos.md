ok so its clear i am going to improve my api page for SEO and also my rapidapi docs and then i come up with an posting strategy. and i need to make a hierarchy list of which apis to implement next.


- improve landing page for seo and also crawl page for google search results
- improve rapid docs finally (ready for scaling)
- make a posting strategy for twitter and linkedin
- hierarchy list of which apis to implement next
- scaling of apis based on hierarchy list and my routine steps for making an api
