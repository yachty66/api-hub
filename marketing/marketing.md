## GitHub

1. Make a repo with the same name as API 
2. Use prompt """Based on this document, what is the optimal SEO description for the GitHub repo? Here is a good example from another repo of mine:

ðŸš€ Midjourney Python API: Unofficial wrapper for AI art generation. ðŸŽ¨ Python-friendly, easy setup, for developers & artists. Python, AI, Midjourney, art, technology, image gen" (and link the docs for the respective API)
