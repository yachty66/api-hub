## how to make a marketing campaign

- hackathon
    - once i have 50 apis i can do a hackathon in berlin
- twitter and linkedin account and a discord
    - 
- SEO for developers
- list in API directories
    - https://apilist.fun
        - doesnt work - tried reaching out to @surfcoderepeat
    - https://apilayer.com/marketplace - no public market place
    - https://apis.guru - worked by adding the api to the directory
    - https://apitracker.io/trending - no marketplace
    - https://apislist.com - published but was not able to login, contacted @SamyMassoud
    - https://www.postman.com/explore   
        - before adding the openapi file i first need to change the server url to the one from rapidapi
        - success, need to upload the openapi file and manually include the url to my api on rapidapi and the description for the api
        - need to manually test the endpoint after adding
        - need to make sure later that the api is publicly discoverable because this is not the case right now 
    - https://apicontext.com/api-directory - not public
    - https://marketplace.builtapi.com - not public
    - https://www.api-ninjas.com/api - not public
    - https://www.apistack.io/category/directories - sucks
- make a github org and for each api a repo?

## GitHub

1. Make a repo with the same name as API 
2. Use prompt """Based on this document, what is the optimal SEO description for the GitHub repo? Here is a good example from another repo of mine:

ðŸš€ Midjourney Python API: Unofficial wrapper for AI art generation. ðŸŽ¨ Python-friendly, easy setup, for developers & artists. Python, AI, Midjourney, art, technology, image gen" (and link the docs for the respective API)
"""
